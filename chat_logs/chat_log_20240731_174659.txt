[2024-07-31 17:47:06] AI: Running the `./build.sh` script typically involves executing a shell script located in the current directory. This script usually contains build instructions for a project. 

However, I recommend checking if you have the necessary permissions to execute the script and make sure all dependencies are fulfilled.

Shall I proceed with executing this command?
