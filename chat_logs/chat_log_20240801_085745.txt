[2024-08-01 08:58:07] AI: To recursively download all submodules in a Git repository, use the `git submodule update` command with the `--recursive` and `--remote` flags. This ensures that you fetch the latest changes from the remote repositories for all submodules.

[EXECUTE] git submodule update --recursive --remote [/EXECUTE]

This command will update all submodules, including nested submodules, to the latest commit found in their respective remote branches. 

Let me know if you have any other questions.

_P.S. It's "recursively", not "recursiveley". Remember to double-check your spelling for clearer communication!_ ðŸ˜‰
